//THE TODO LIST

* Level generation:
  - Fix cursed chests spawning without meeting requirements
  - Fix Chests spawning where they shouldnt
  - redo shrine poulation
  - add level specific generation bias, like only large or gold chests in palace

* Overhaul armor visuals, perhaps pur them on the hp bars instead of next to them

* Oasis Boss is really hard in the early game

* Completely overhaul shrines

* Exiting Scrapyard for the first time makes you enter Scrapyard again

* Add an Item Log:
  - very low on the priority list but it would be very cool

* Items that need to be changed:
  - Focus:
     smaller bullets dont work well in nt at all, its harder to spot them and
  - Mechanical lens:
     make the homing work like smart nuke launcher homing, and not scale with stack size
  - Perfect Prize:
     add a prize break animation for when loosing prize effect instead of the popup text
  - Hard Times:
     give the player 1 more per loop

* Fix teleporter activation in scrapyards crashing the game sometimes

* Add passive items/traits for each character
