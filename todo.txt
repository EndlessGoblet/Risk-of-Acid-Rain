//THE TODO LIST

* Level generation:
  - Fix cursed chests spawning without meeting requirements
  - Fix Chests spawning where they shouldnt
  - redo shrine poulation
  - add level specific generation bias, like only large or gold chests in palace

* Add Classic Mode:
  - get a couple of items per start (presets), gain more per loop

* Add an Item Log:
  - very low on the priority list but it would be very cool

* Update interface elements on the main screen

* Items that need to be changed:
  - Focus:
     smaller bullets dont work well in nt at all, its harder to spot them and
  - Liquid Nitrogen:
     effect is too weak to be of any value and the blue circle should either be
     behind the player or removed by a custom "entering" particle on the incoming
     projectile
  - Broken Locket:
     seems to spawn way too many Rusted Chests
  - Mechanical lens:
     make the homing work like smart nuke launcher homing, and not scale with stack size
  - Gun Boots:
     Being able to create projectiles just by moving seems kinda wierd and in late game
     is broken due to multidudes of synergies. dont even have to use ammo to kill enemies
  - Chopper:
     see Gun Boots
  - Perfect Prize:
     add a prize break animation for when loosing prize effect instead of the popup text
  - Fern:
     overthink wether or not we actually want this
  - Flower Cactus:
     i like it, and im gonna line out here how i think it could work well
     - on level start, carve a nook into the level similar to safe spawn and put the cactus in the middle
     - cactus has an aoe that grants invisibility up to a limit, and heals you under certain circumstances (?)
     - 1 health cactus
  - Hard Times:
     give the player 1 more per loop
  - Ammo Extractor:
     needs a resprite

* Fix item inventory backdrop not scaling vertically properly

* Add uncursed items, and make cursed items uncurse
  - like cursed items but without the downside, with a custom rarity

* Fix teleporter activation in scrapyards crashing the game sometimes
