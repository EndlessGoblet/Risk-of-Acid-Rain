//THE TODO LIST

* Level generation:
  - Fix cursed chests spawning without meeting requirements
  - Fix Chests spawning where they shouldnt
  - redo shrine poulation
  - add level specific generation bias, like only large or gold chests in palace

* Add Classic Mode:
  - get a couple of items per start (presets), gain more per loop

* Overhaul armor visuals, perhaps pur them on the hp bars instead of next to them

* Hard Times currently dont seem to be handed out at the start of hardmode

* Oasis Boss is really hard in the early game

* Completely overhaul shrines

* Exiting Scrapyard for the first time makes you enter Scrapyard again

* Add an Item Log:
  - very low on the priority list but it would be very cool

* Items that need to be changed:
  - Focus:
     smaller bullets dont work well in nt at all, its harder to spot them and
  - Liquid Nitrogen:
     effect is too weak to be of any value and the blue circle should either be
     behind the player or removed by a custom "entering" particle on the incoming
     projectile
  - Mechanical lens:
     make the homing work like smart nuke launcher homing, and not scale with stack size
  - Chopper:
     Being able to create projectiles just by moving seems kinda wierd and in late game
     is broken due to multidudes of synergies. dont even have to use ammo to kill enemies
  - Perfect Prize:
     add a prize break animation for when loosing prize effect instead of the popup text
  - Flower Cactus:
     i like it, and im gonna line out here how i think it could work well
     - on level start, carve a nook into the level similar to safe spawn and put the cactus in the middle
     - cactus has an aoe that grants invisibility up to a limit, and heals you under certain circumstances (?)
     - 1 health cactus
  - Hard Times:
     give the player 1 more per loop
  - Ammo Extractor:
     needs a resprite

* Fix teleporter activation in scrapyards crashing the game sometimes
